You have chosen well! This is a fantastic spooky model to choose from!

DESCRIPTION:
This prefab is FULLY ANIMATED! WITH SOUNDS! WITH HEALTH BAR!
This prefab comes with a complex enemy AI that does the following:
    - Patrols a navmesh in search of a player
    - Runs towards said player when found
    - Attacks player when close

USAGE:
To use, place enemy on a NavMeshSurface in Unity. For information on how to do
this, simply search the Unity API Documentation. 

To damage the ghoul, use the HitEnemy function on the LightEnemy script. 
You must pass in the weapon type (compatible weapon types are listed in 
BaseEnemy.cs), and the damage the enemy should take.

To get the enemy to realize the player, the player must have the GameObject 
name of "Player". This is how the enemy is able to understand what GameObject 
the player is.

To tweak the health/attack/ values, take a peek at LightEnemy.cs 
and BaseEnemy.cs and change the starting values in the Start() functions.


Once this is done, the enemy will now patrol around, creating sounds while 
walking, running, attacking, and dying. Have fun with your new spooky asset!
