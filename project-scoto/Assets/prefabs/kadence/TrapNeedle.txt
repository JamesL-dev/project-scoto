Trap Needle Prefab

Description: This dungeon trap prefab if fully editable and is already animated.

Purpose:  This trap adds another obstacle for the player to avoid while 
navigating through each level. 

Interactions: This prefab is instantiated a random number of times per room based on room size after the level is generated via the Obstacle 
Spawner Script. If the player GameObject marked with the Player tag collides with the trap then the player loses health via the Trap Needle 
Script. The damage can be adjusted.
