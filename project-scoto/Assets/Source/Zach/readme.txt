The feature I will be championing for this project is the level design and generation for our game.
Our game will consist of an endless series of levels.
Each level will be a set of rooms connected into a procedurally-generated maze.
Each room will be random and can contain traps, enemies, rewards, puzzles, etc. that the player must deal with before they can leave.
Every level will have one exit room that the player must reach to get to the next level.
Each time a level is completed, a new one is generated.
As the player progresses, the levels will get longer and/or more difficult.
When the player loses, they restart at the beginning of the game but with different generated levels and rooms.
