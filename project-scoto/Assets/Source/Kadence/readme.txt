My feature will consist of the traps and obstacles for ScoSoft's new 3D maze game Scoto. 
I will be designing three obstacles that coordinate with Scoto's Greek theme: a snake pit, giant boulder, and extending spikes. 
The player will have a short response time to press the correct button to avoid the trap, or else their health will be severely diminished. 
Since a new maze will be proceduarlly generated every level, the traps and obstacles will be randomly spawned.
